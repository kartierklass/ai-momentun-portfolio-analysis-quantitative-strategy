# MomentumFlow: An AI-Powered Quantitative Strategy Engine ðŸš€

**MomentumFlow is a complete, end-to-end Python framework for developing, testing, and understanding AI-driven stock trading strategies. This project moves beyond simple model building to create a robust backtesting engine that evaluates performance, identifies common pitfalls like overfitting, and uses Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret a model's decision-making process.**

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore the viability of an AI-enhanced momentum investing strategy. The system automates the entire quantitative research workflow:

* **Data Pipeline**: Fetches historical stock price data using the `yfinance` API.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creates a rich feature set, including multi-period momentum signals (1, 3, 6, and 12-month) and rolling volatility as a risk metric.
* **Comparative Modeling**: Trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models, starting with a baseline `RandomForest` and upgrading to a more powerful `XGBoost` model to improve generalization.
* **Backtesting Engine**: Implements a robust backtesting framework to simulate the strategy's performance on unseen data, comparing it against a simple equal-weighted benchmark.
* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Integrates model interpretability using feature importance analysis to understand the key drivers behind the AI's predictions.

## The Core Finding: A Realistic Outcome

A key outcome of this project was the practical demonstration of **overfitting** in a financial context. The initial RandomForest model achieved a near-perfect training score (RÂ² of 0.98) but failed significantly on test data (RÂ² of -0.37).

Upgrading to an XGBoost model produced a more realistic and healthier result, reducing overfitting (Training RÂ² of 0.47) and improving test performance. However, the final backtest confirmed that even this improved model did not outperform the benchmark. This is a realistic outcome in quantitative finance and highlights that the primary value of this project is the **framework itself**â€”a powerful tool for rapidly prototyping and validating new ideas.

## Model Interpretability: Understanding the "Why"

Using XGBoost's built-in feature importance, we analyzed the "brain" of our best-performing model. The analysis revealed that long-term momentum and recent volatility were the most influential factors in its decision-making process. This step moves beyond a "black box" approach to provide crucial insights into the model's behavior.
