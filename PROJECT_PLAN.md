# Project Blueprint: AI-Enhanced Momentum Portfolio

## 1. The Vision üé®

Our goal is to build a smart investment tool. We will start with a classic investment strategy called **Momentum Investing** (buying stocks that are already doing well) and enhance it using **Machine Learning**. Our AI will analyze various types of momentum to create a superior "synthesized momentum score," aiming to achieve higher returns and lower risk.

## 2. The Tech Stack (Our Tools & Paints) üõ†Ô∏è

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries (Our Paintbrushes):**
    * `pandas`: To organize our data, like a painter's palette.
    * `yfinance`: To get historical stock price data from the internet.
    * `scikit-learn`: Our AI toolkit for building the machine learning model.
    * `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: To create beautiful charts and graphs to display our results.

## 3. The Creation Process (Step-by-Step Plan) üñåÔ∏è

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Studio**
* Create our project folder structure (`data`, `notebooks`, `src`).
* Install all the necessary Python libraries.

**Phase 2: Gathering Our Materials (Data Collection)**
* Write a script to automatically download historical price data for a list of stocks (e.g., components of the S&P 500).
* Clean the data to handle any missing values or errors.

**Phase 3: Painting the Background (Baseline Model)**
* Calculate a simple, classic 12-month momentum score for each stock.
* Build a basic portfolio based on this simple score to see how it performs. This is our benchmark‚Äîthe "before" picture.

**Phase 4: The AI's Masterstroke (ML Model)**
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new, smarter features for our AI. This includes short-term momentum (1-month, 3-month), long-term momentum (6-month), and volatility.
* **Model Training:** Train a `RandomForest` model (a popular AI model) to look at all these features and predict which stocks are the best to buy. The model's prediction is our unique **"synthesized momentum score."**

**Phase 5: The Grand Reveal (Backtesting & Visualization)**
* Build a new, "enhanced" portfolio using our AI's synthesized scores.
* Run a simulation (backtest) to see how our new portfolio would have performed in the past.
* Create clear comparison charts showing our portfolio's returns and risk versus the simple baseline portfolio.

**Phase 6: Framing the Masterpiece (Documentation & GitHub)**
* Write a clear `README.md` file explaining what the project is, what we discovered, and how to run it.
* Publish the entire project to GitHub so interviewers and the world can see our work.
